# drc_task_common

## Setup
1. Setup your account allowing sudo without password and keep environmental variable.

  It's required to use socket port 1-1023.

  Run following command
   ```
$ sudo visudo
```

  And add these lines:
  ```
  YOUR_ACCOUNT ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
  Defaults env_keep += "PYTHONPATH"
  Defaults env_keep += "ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"
  Defaults env_keep += "ROS_MASTER_URI"
  ```

  And restart your computer.

## Introduction
provides drc\_task\_ common task programs.

## drc_task_common.launch

### DEVICE
this program needs
* 3D mouse (for move t-marker)
* B-Controll (for some bottuns)
* Track ball mouse (for move robot head)

### DEPEND
sudo aptitude install python-pygame
sudo pip install fysom

### How to launch
You should put two commands in the defferent terminal
```
roslaunch drc_task_common drc_task_common_hrp2jsknts.launch
roscd drc_task_common/config; rosrun rviz rviz -d drc_task_common.rviz
```

### Launch file components
drc\_task\_common is made up of 8 components,
preparing... Please read drc_task_common.launch


### How to Use B-Controll Interface
B-Controll provides 2x8 Buttons and 8 bars. This Section Introduces how to use buttons

![](images/b_control_real.jpg)

for more details, please read source codes
https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_demos/blob/master/jsk_2015_06_hrp_drc/drc_task_common/scripts/b_control_client.py provides bottun interface

#### Upper, (1, 2, 3) From the Left,(Box, Cylinder, Torus) Button
Change Transformable Marker Type, for (Box, Cylinder, Torus) Like Objects.

#### Upper, 4 From the Left, SETPOS Button
Auto Move Robot Before T-Object Marker.(Maybe before 50cm from Objects, But Needs Some Changes)

#### Upper, 5 From the Left, GOPOS Button
Go Pos From Real Pos To Robot Marker Pos.
(Push U8 or D8 to Select)

#### Upper, 6 From the Left, Save Button
SAVE CURRENT OBJECT POSE(for moving object)

#### Upper, 7 From the Left, TOGGLE Button
Not Used

#### Lower, 1 From the Left, APPROACH Button
Change IK mode
* None (Simply solve IK with the coords)
* Reach (Solve IK to Reach object coords)
* Release (Solve IK to Release object)
current mode is displayed on rviz.


#### Lower, 2 From the Left, Mode Button
Change Marker Setting Mode,
* autoset (object will be set by click b-box)
* manuset (manual set object with 3d mouse)
* assoc (object will be assoced to robot hand coords)
current mode is displayed on rviz.

#### Lower, 3 From the Left, Menu Button
Launch Menu
* reverse (reverse object coords (z-axis will be reversed))
* chancel (close menu)

#### Lower, 4 From the Left, IK Button
solve IK with current robot pos and current t-object coords,
Robot model will be change pose with the result

#### Lower, 5 From the Left, Angle Button
send robot model's angle to real robot, You can change the velocity by changing the most right bar.

#### Lower, 6 From the Left, Menu Button
Launch Robot menu
* cancel
* switch irm (change ik arm)
* inverse-reachabily-map-mode
* reachability-map-mode
* reset pose (change robot model pose)
* reset pose (::)


### How to Use RVIZ Object User Interface
This is for manipulating other objects. Based on PointCloud Marker.
This also uses B-Control Interface for ANGLE and other Buttons.

#### Needed Rviz Object
preparing.... (may be in config/drc_task_common.rviz)

#### Flow
First, choose b-box in rviz.
Then, Interactive Cloud Marker will be made.
Click point in Cloud Marker, then One Circle(Menu Marker) will be made.
Right-Click it, then you can make other Marker, if you Right-Click this Marker, You can make robot solve ik.

#### Markers

##### Cloud Marker
![](images/none_marker.png)

You can move this with 6-Dof Control, you can select points of cloud for create menu marker

##### Menu Marker
show menu, this marker creates other markers.

##### Push Marker
![](images/push_marker.png)

show push point

##### Grasp Marke
![](images/grasp_marker.png)

show grasp point

##### Restraint Marker
![](images/restraint_marker.png)

show restraint, robot may solve ik with :x by this arrow.

#### Trouble shoot for this interface
Q. I can not select points !

A. We cannot select points over other Interactive marker, so please move Cloud Marker or delete other markers

Q. The IK Result is different from the result I thought.

A. This Interface provides two Base Frame, grasp commands and push command uses manipulate_frame and move command uses marker_frame. Before move commands done, robot thinks that The objects doesn't move. In other words, manipulate_frame does moves when move-object Event Driven.

### Trouble Shoot

Q. I can't move robot-head.

A. You should change mode for mouse, first, to know if mouse is connected
```
sudo hexdump mouse0
```
then, you should put command
```
sudo chmod 644 mouse0
```

Q. The following error occurred.
```
